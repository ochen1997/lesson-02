        <p>
          Alignment is the placement of elements so they line up in composition,
          in design we use alignment to orgaize elements, to group elements, to
          create balance to create structure, to create connection between
          elements, to create sharp and clear outcome. Alignment is commonly
          achieved with the use of grid. A grid can create an invisble structure
          on which visual elements can be placed. These grid can ensure accurate
          alignment and consistency in large piece of design work.

        <h3>Proximity</h3>

        <p>
          Leveraging proximity to create meaningful groups is reflected even
          when presenting basic text content: sentences are grouped together in
          paragraphs separated above and below by whitespace. Further,
          whitespace around well-designed headings signals which paragraphs they
          are associated with the text from the corresponding section is usually
          placed closer to the heading than the text from the preceding section.
          Placing related elements in close proximity and using whitespace to
          create meaningful groups is a foundational principle in visual design.
          Users are task-focused and may scan pages quite quickly, so making
          these groupings visually obvious increases usability by helping users
          quickly find and focus only on those UI elements that are most related
          to their current task.

        <h3>Space and clean design</h3>

          Using white space evenly makes the content in design easily scannable
          and significantly improves legibility. A study conducted indicates
          that proper use of white space between lines of paragraphs and its
          left and right margins can increase comprehension up to 20%. Such
          small spaces between lines, paragraph.Large spaces between layouts and
          layout elements, also called as Macro White Spaces help greatly in
          guiding the users through the page and prioritising the focus area for
          the user.
